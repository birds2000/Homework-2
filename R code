## Question #1

### A.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Download the data set
profs <- read.csv('profs.csv')
#Create plot A
ggplot(profs) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = eval))
```

### B.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Create plot B
ggplot(profs) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = native, y = eval))
```

### C. 
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Create faceted plot C
ggplot(profs) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = eval), binwidth = 1) +

### D.
```{r, echo = FALSE}
